# SJSU Python Projects

This repository is a collection of several python projects from the Fall 2020 semester at SJSU.

&nbsp;

## HMM_viterbi

The viterbi algorithm was implemented to find the most probable state path and the path probability of a given DNA sequence.

&nbsp;

## ML_heart_failure

This project was in introduction to machine learning. ML models were applied on a dataset of patients with heart failure to predict patient outcome. The dataset was processed and analyzed using Pandas and Seaborn. ML models were created with scikit-learn.

Chicco, D., Jurman, G. Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone. *BMC Med Inform Decis Mak* **20,** 16 (2020). <https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5>

## Traveling_Salesperson_Genetic_Algorithm

A genetic algorithm was implemented to solve the Traveling Salesperson problem. Given a distance matrix of cities, find the shortest route of all cities where each city is only visited once.
